# text_generator

A simple text generator using markov's chain algorithm

## How to use it ?
> ./text_generator file.txt number_of_note_to_generate

for example you can test
> ./text_generator example/random.txt 25

The program will display the Shannon's entropy of the text, more the entropy is high more the generated text will be different from the original text

For this program a text will be only represented as a list of words. It's just a little project I've done to learn Markov's chain.
