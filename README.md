# music_generator

A simple music generator using markov's chain algorithm

## How to use it ?
> ./music_generator file.music number_of_note_to_generate

for example you can test
> ./music_generator example/to_the_moon.music 25

The program will display the Shannon's entropy of the music, more the entropy is high more the generated music will be different from the original music

For this program a music will be only represented as a list of notes. It's just a little project I've done to learn Markov's chain.
